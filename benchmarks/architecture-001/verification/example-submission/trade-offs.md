# Architectural Trade-offs Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the key architectural trade-offs made in designing the collaborative document editing platform. Each major decision involved evaluating multiple alternatives with different strengths and weaknesses. Below we document what we're gaining, what we're sacrificing, and why we made each choice.

## 1. CRDT vs Operational Transformation for Collaboration

### Decision
Use CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) via Yjs library.

### Alternatives Considered
- Operational Transformation (OT)
- Last-Write-Wins with locking
- Hybrid OT + CRDT

### Evaluation Criteria
- Implementation complexity and risk
- Time to market (6-month MVP constraint)
- Multi-region support
- Offline editing capability
- Team expertise required
- Operational complexity

### Trade-off Analysis

**What We're Gaining:**
- **Lower implementation risk**: CRDTs are mathematically guaranteed to converge, reducing the risk of subtle synchronization bugs that plague OT implementations
- **Better offline support**: CRDTs naturally support offline editing with automatic sync, a key differentiator
- **Multi-region friendly**: No need for central coordination - each region can operate independently
- **Faster time to market**: Yjs is a mature library that works out of the box, versus building OT from scratch
- **Simpler mental model**: Easier for team to understand and debug

**What We're Sacrificing:**
- **Storage overhead**: CRDTs require additional metadata (15-30% larger than plain text)
- **Memory footprint**: CRDT data structures in memory are larger than OT equivalents
- **Less control**: Automatic conflict resolution means we can't implement custom merge logic for specific cases
- **Potential for unexpected behavior**: Users may occasionally see "zombie" edits (deleted content reappearing) if not handled carefully

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Storage overhead**: Implement periodic document compaction to reduce CRDT metadata
- **Memory**: Monitor memory usage, add document size limits if needed
- **Zombie edits**: Implement proper tombstone handling, document best practices for team
- **Budget**: Allocate extra 20% storage capacity in initial cost estimates

### Re-evaluation Triggers
- If storage costs exceed 2x baseline estimates
- If memory usage prevents scaling to target concurrency
- If user complaints about zombie edits exceed 1% of users
- If we need business-specific conflict resolution that CRDTs can't support

**Verdict:** The reduced implementation risk and faster time to market outweigh the storage overhead for our use case.

## 2. PostgreSQL vs MongoDB for Primary Database

### Decision
Use PostgreSQL with JSONB for document storage.

### Alternatives Considered
- MongoDB (document-oriented)
- DynamoDB (key-value)
- Hybrid (PostgreSQL for metadata + MongoDB for documents)

### Evaluation Criteria
- Strong consistency requirements
- Complex permission queries
- Flexible document schema
- Operational expertise
- Cost at scale
- Compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR)

### Trade-off Analysis

**What We're Gaining:**
- **ACID guarantees**: Critical for permissions and billing operations - zero tolerance for permission bugs
- **Flexible querying**: Complex permission checks are easier with SQL joins and WHERE clauses
- **Dual data model**: Relational tables for structured data, JSONB for flexible document content
- **Mature ecosystem**: Excellent tooling, backup solutions, monitoring, ORMs
- **Team expertise**: Team has more PostgreSQL experience than MongoDB
- **Compliance**: Well-understood compliance story for SOC 2 audits

**What We're Sacrificing:**
- **Horizontal scaling complexity**: PostgreSQL doesn't shard automatically like MongoDB - we'll need to manually shard if we outgrow a single instance
- **Document-native operations**: MongoDB's document operations are more natural for document editing
- **Write scalability**: Single-writer bottleneck for primary instance (mitigated with read replicas)
- **Schema flexibility**: While JSONB helps, migrations are still more complex than MongoDB

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Write bottleneck**: Start with read replicas, implement caching, batch CRDT writes
- **Horizontal scaling**: Plan for sharding by organization_id if we hit single-instance limits
- **Monitoring**: Track write load closely, set alerts at 70% of instance capacity
- **Escape hatch**: Design data model so migration to MongoDB is possible if needed

### Re-evaluation Triggers
- Write load exceeding 10,000 TPS (near PostgreSQL single-instance limit)
- Complex permission queries taking >100ms despite optimization
- Storage exceeding 10TB (cost of large PostgreSQL instances becomes prohibitive)
- Need for more flexible schema changes than JSONB provides

**Verdict:** Strong consistency and flexible querying for permissions are more important than native document operations.

## 3. WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events for Real-time

### Decision
Use WebSockets with Socket.io library.

### Alternatives Considered
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Long Polling
- WebRTC Data Channels

### Evaluation Criteria
- Latency requirements (<100ms P95)
- Bidirectional communication needs
- Browser compatibility
- Operational complexity
- Fallback mechanisms

### Trade-off Analysis

**What We're Gaining:**
- **True bidirectional**: Client and server can both initiate messages without overhead
- **Low latency**: Persistent connection eliminates connection setup overhead
- **Efficient**: Less bandwidth than polling-based approaches
- **Mature ecosystem**: Socket.io provides auto-reconnection, room support, fallbacks
- **Better UX**: Instant push of edits feels more responsive than SSE

**What We're Sacrificing:**
- **Stateful connections**: Each WebSocket connection holds state, requiring sticky sessions or Redis coordination
- **Scaling complexity**: Need Redis pub/sub to coordinate messages across multiple server instances
- **Load balancer complexity**: Requires WebSocket-aware load balancing configuration
- **Proxy compatibility**: Some corporate firewalls block WebSocket connections (though Socket.io falls back to polling)

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Sticky sessions**: Configure load balancer with IP hash or cookie-based sticky sessions
- **Redis pub/sub**: Use Redis to coordinate messages across instances
- **Firewall blocking**: Socket.io automatically falls back to long polling if WebSockets fail
- **Connection limits**: Monitor connections per instance, auto-scale at 5,000 connections/instance

### Re-evaluation Triggers
- Connection success rate drops below 95% (firewall blocking issues)
- Redis pub/sub becomes a bottleneck (>10,000 messages/second)
- WebSocket infrastructure costs exceed 30% of total infrastructure
- Operational complexity significantly slows development

**Verdict:** Bidirectional low-latency communication is essential for real-time editing experience.

## 4. Monolith vs Microservices Architecture

### Decision
Start with a **hybrid approach**: Core monolith with separate real-time service.

### Alternatives Considered
- Pure monolith (all in one service)
- Full microservices (10+ separate services)
- Modular monolith

### Evaluation Criteria
- Development velocity (6-month timeline)
- Team size (10 engineers initially)
- Operational complexity
- Deployment flexibility
- Future scaling needs

### Trade-off Analysis

**What We're Gaining:**
- **Faster development**: Shared codebase, less inter-service communication overhead
- **Simpler deployments**: Fewer moving pieces, easier to reason about
- **Lower operational burden**: Fewer services to monitor, debug, and maintain
- **Easier testing**: Integration tests don't require complex service orchestration
- **Cost-effective**: Don't pay for overhead of service mesh, API gateway complexity
- **Scalability where needed**: Real-time service can scale independently (most resource-intensive)

**What We're Sacrificing:**
- **Independent scaling**: Can't scale search and permissions separately from core app
- **Technology flexibility**: Hard to use different languages/frameworks for different components
- **Team autonomy**: Teams can't deploy services independently
- **Blast radius**: Bug in one module can affect entire application
- **Future flexibility**: Harder to extract services later if needed

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Modular design**: Structure code in modules with clear boundaries (services within monolith)
- **Independent real-time service**: Separate most resource-intensive component (WebSocket handling)
- **Clear interfaces**: Design module APIs as if they were separate services
- **Monitoring**: Track module-level metrics to identify scaling bottlenecks
- **Migration path**: Plan for extracting services (search, auth) if needed in Phase 2

### Re-evaluation Triggers
- Team grows beyond 30 engineers (coordination overhead increases)
- Different components have wildly different scaling needs
- Deployment frequency limited by monolith release cycle
- Single module's issues impact entire application availability

**Verdict:** For MVP with small team and tight timeline, a hybrid approach balances simplicity with flexibility.

## 5. Multi-Region Active-Active vs Active-Passive

### Decision
Deploy **active-active** in US-East and EU-West regions.

### Alternatives Considered
- Single region (US-East only)
- Active-passive (primary + standby)
- Regional isolation (no cross-region replication)

### Evaluation Criteria
- Global latency requirements
- High availability (99.9% SLA)
- Complexity and cost
- Data consistency needs
- Disaster recovery

### Trade-off Analysis

**What We're Gaining:**
- **Lower latency globally**: Users connect to nearest region (<100ms for 90% of users)
- **Higher availability**: One region failing doesn't impact users in other regions
- **Better user experience**: Faster load times and real-time edits for EU users
- **Disaster recovery**: Automatic failover if one region goes down
- **Growth enablement**: Can add Asia-Pacific region easily in Phase 3

**What We're Sacrificing:**
- **Complexity**: Need cross-region database replication and conflict resolution
- **Cost**: 2x infrastructure cost (running in two regions)
- **Consistency challenges**: Eventual consistency across regions (100-300ms lag)
- **Operational burden**: More infrastructure to monitor, maintain, and debug
- **Data compliance**: Need to ensure data residency for GDPR (EU data stays in EU)

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Conflict resolution**: CRDTs handle cross-region conflicts automatically
- **Cost**: Start with smaller instances in EU-West, scale based on demand
- **Consistency**: Set user expectations (99.9% of edits are near-instant, cross-region may have slight delay)
- **Monitoring**: Cross-region replication lag alerts, separate dashboards per region
- **Data residency**: Logically partition EU customer data to EU region only

### Re-evaluation Triggers
- Cross-region replication lag consistently exceeds 1 second
- Operational complexity significantly slows development
- Infrastructure costs exceed 40% of revenue
- Data residency requirements become incompatible with active-active

**Verdict:** Global user base and latency requirements justify multi-region complexity and cost.

## 6. Build vs Buy for Search (Elasticsearch vs Managed Service)

### Decision
Use **managed Elasticsearch** (AWS OpenSearch or Elastic Cloud).

### Alternatives Considered
- Self-hosted Elasticsearch on EC2
- PostgreSQL full-text search
- Algolia or other search SaaS
- Build custom search with PostgreSQL + trigrams

### Evaluation Criteria
- Search quality requirements
- Operational burden
- Cost at scale
- Team expertise
- Time to market

### Trade-off Analysis

**What We're Gaining:**
- **Reduced operational burden**: No need to manage Elasticsearch cluster, upgrades, backups
- **Faster time to market**: Don't need to become Elasticsearch experts
- **Better reliability**: Managed service handles failover, monitoring, scaling
- **Cost-effective initially**: Don't pay for dedicated ops engineers
- **Focus on product**: Team can focus on features instead of infrastructure

**What We're Sacrificing:**
- **Higher cost at scale**: Managed services more expensive than self-hosted at high volume
- **Less control**: Can't customize cluster configuration as deeply
- **Vendor dependency**: Harder to migrate away from managed service
- **Potential limitations**: May hit managed service limits (cluster size, API rate limits)

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Cost monitoring**: Track search costs, evaluate self-hosted if costs exceed $5,000/month
- **Abstraction layer**: Design search interface so backend can be swapped
- **Fallback**: Keep PostgreSQL full-text search as backup if Elasticsearch fails
- **Migration path**: If costs become prohibitive, can migrate to self-hosted

### Re-evaluation Triggers
- Managed search costs exceed $5,000/month
- Need custom Elasticsearch configuration not available in managed service
- Managed service availability below 99.5%
- Team gains enough Elasticsearch expertise that self-hosting becomes viable

**Verdict:** For MVP, managed service reduces risk and operational burden at reasonable cost.

## 7. Node.js vs Other Backend Runtimes

### Decision
Use **Node.js** for application and real-time services.

### Alternatives Considered
- Go (for better performance)
- Python with Django/FastAPI
- Java/Kotlin with Spring Boot
- Polyglot approach (different languages for different services)

### Evaluation Criteria
- Real-time I/O requirements
- Team expertise
- Ecosystem maturity
- Performance needs
- Development velocity

### Trade-off Analysis

**What We're Gaining:**
- **Great for I/O-bound work**: Non-blocking I/O perfect for WebSocket handling and API requests
- **Single language**: JavaScript/TypeScript across frontend and backend (easier context switching)
- **Rich ecosystem**: Excellent libraries for WebSockets (Socket.io), CRDTs (Yjs), database access
- **Fast development**: Dynamic typing + good tooling = rapid prototyping
- **Good performance**: Fast enough for I/O-bound work (our primary workload)

**What We're Sacrificing:**
- **CPU-intensive work**: Not ideal for heavy computation (document export, PDF generation)
- **Type safety**: Even with TypeScript, not as strong as Go or Java
- **Memory efficiency**: V8 uses more memory than Go or Java in many cases
- **Concurrency model**: Single-threaded event loop harder to reason about than Go goroutines
- **Performance ceiling**: Lower than Go for CPU-bound work

### Mitigation Strategies
- **CPU-intensive tasks**: Offload to separate workers (Python/Go) via RabbitMQ
- **Type safety**: Use TypeScript strictly, ESLint, comprehensive tests
- **Memory**: Monitor memory usage, use clustering for multi-core utilization
- **Worker threads**: Use Node.js worker threads for CPU-bound tasks if needed

### Re-evaluation Triggers
- CPU usage consistently at 80%+ on I/O-bound operations
- Memory usage per instance exceeds acceptable limits
- Need for heavy computation that Node.js can't handle efficiently
- Team expertise shifts to other languages

**Verdict:** Node.js is the right choice for I/O-heavy real-time application with JavaScript/TypeScript team.
