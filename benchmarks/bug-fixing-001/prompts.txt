=== TASK ===
Fix a bug in the daterange utility library that is causing one test to fail.

=== CONTEXT ===
The codebase is a Python library located in the `src/` directory. The test suite is in the `tests/` directory.

Currently, when you run the tests with `python3 -m pytest tests/`, one test fails:
- `test_business_days_one_week_span` - This test is failing due to a bug in the `get_business_days()` function

The bug is an off-by-one error in the loop condition. The function should count business days inclusively (including both start_date and end_date), but it's currently excluding the end_date.

All other tests are passing and should continue to pass after your fix.

=== DELIVERABLES ===
1. Identify the bug in `src/daterange.py`
2. Fix the bug with a minimal change
3. Ensure all tests pass

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Do not modify any test files
- Do not change function signatures or the public API
- Only fix the bug - do not refactor or add new features
- Use only Python standard library

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your implementation.
You can also run tests directly with: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
