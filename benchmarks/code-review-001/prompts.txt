=== TASK ===
Review Pull Request #142 for the User Management System. Identify all bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality problems in the submitted code.

=== CONTEXT ===
- The code to review is in `starter-code/user_manager.py`
- This is a new user management module that handles authentication, data retrieval, and session management
- The module uses SQLite for data storage
- Review the PR description in `starter-code/PR_DIFF.md` for context
- The code contains a mix of correct implementations and buggy code

=== DELIVERABLES ===
Provide a comprehensive code review report that includes:

1. For each issue found, provide:
   - A descriptive title
   - Severity classification (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW)
   - Specific line number(s) where the issue occurs
   - Clear description of what's wrong
   - Explanation of the potential impact
   - Actionable suggestion for how to fix it

2. Format each issue as:
   ```
   ## Issue [N]: [Brief Title]
   - **Severity**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
   - **Location**: Line [number]
   - **Description**: [What's wrong]
   - **Impact**: [What could happen]
   - **Suggestion**: [How to fix it]
   ```

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- You must provide specific line numbers for each issue
- Classify severity appropriately based on actual impact
- Do not flag correct code as problematic - there is working code mixed in
- Focus on issues that would actually matter in production
- Provide actionable, specific suggestions (not vague advice)

Severity Guidelines:
- CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities, data loss, crashes
- HIGH: Logic errors, resource leaks, race conditions
- MEDIUM: Performance problems, missing error handling
- LOW: Minor code quality or style issues

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your review quality.
Your score will be based on:
- Bug detection rate (did you find the actual bugs?)
- False positive rate (did you avoid flagging correct code?)
- Severity accuracy (did you classify issues correctly?)
- Feedback quality (are your suggestions actionable?)
