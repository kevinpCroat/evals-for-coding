=== TASK ===
Design and implement a complete database schema for a blog platform using SQLAlchemy ORM. You need to create models with proper relationships, constraints, indexes, and an initial migration script.

=== CONTEXT ===
Read requirements.md for complete business requirements including:
- 7 entities to model (User, Article, Category, Tag, Comment, ArticleTag, UserFollow)
- Relationship definitions and cardinality
- Business rules and constraints
- Query requirements for index optimization

Read spec.md for technical specifications including:
- Exact deliverables needed
- SQLAlchemy and Alembic requirements
- Success criteria and scoring breakdown

=== DELIVERABLES ===
Create the following files in /Users/kperko/code/evals-for-coding/benchmarks/data-modelling-001/:

1. models.py
   - All 7 SQLAlchemy model classes
   - Proper field types with constraints (unique, not null, etc.)
   - All relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) with back_populates
   - Indexes for high-priority queries
   - Cascade delete configurations
   - __repr__ methods for debugging

2. alembic.ini
   - Standard Alembic configuration
   - Configured for SQLite (file: blog.db)

3. alembic/env.py
   - Alembic environment setup
   - Import your models
   - Configure target metadata

4. alembic/script.py.mako
   - Standard Alembic migration template

5. alembic/versions/001_initial_schema.py
   - Initial migration that creates all tables
   - Include all indexes and constraints
   - Proper upgrade() and downgrade() functions

6. requirements.txt
   - SQLAlchemy>=2.0
   - Alembic>=1.12
   - psycopg2-binary

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Use SQLAlchemy 2.0+ declarative syntax
- Use timezone-aware datetime fields (UTC)
- Use Integer primary keys (not UUIDs)
- Follow all business rules from requirements.md:
  - Unique constraints on email, username, slugs, tag names
  - Proper cascade delete behaviors
  - Prevent users from following themselves
  - Default values for status fields and counters
- Add indexes for all high-priority queries listed in requirements.md
- Use SQLAlchemy Enum for status fields

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your implementation.

The scoring breakdown:
- Schema Validity (30%): Models create tables without errors
- Relationships (25%): All relationships work bidirectionally
- Constraints (20%): Database enforces data integrity rules
- Migrations (15%): Alembic migration runs successfully
- Query Performance (10%): Required indexes are present

Focus on:
1. Correctly modeling all 7 entities with proper field types
2. Implementing all relationships with foreign keys
3. Adding all constraints (unique, not null, foreign key, check)
4. Creating indexes for common query patterns
5. Writing a working Alembic migration script
