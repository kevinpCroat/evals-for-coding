=== TASK ===
Identify the root cause of the failing test in the LRU cache implementation.

There is one failing test in `starter-code/test_lru_cache.py`. Your job is to:
1. Investigate why the test is failing
2. Identify the ROOT CAUSE of the bug (not just the symptom)
3. Document your analysis process
4. Create a minimal reproduction case
5. Fix the bug

=== CONTEXT ===
You have been provided with an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementation in `starter-code/lru_cache.py`. An LRU cache evicts the least recently used item when it reaches capacity.

The implementation has a subtle bug that causes incorrect behavior in a specific edge case. The bug is NOT a simple syntax error or typo - it requires understanding the logic and execution flow.

Files:
- `starter-code/lru_cache.py` - The buggy implementation
- `starter-code/test_lru_cache.py` - Test suite with one failing test

=== DELIVERABLES ===
Create a file named `ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md` in the starter-code directory with:

1. Investigation Process (20% of score)
   - What you observed from the failing test
   - Hypotheses you explored
   - How you narrowed down the issue

2. Root Cause Analysis (60% of score)
   - The ROOT CAUSE of the bug (be specific)
   - WHY this causes the observed failure
   - Which lines of code are problematic and WHY
   - The logical flaw in the implementation

3. Minimal Reproduction (20% of score)
   - A minimal code snippet that reproduces JUST this bug
   - Strip away all unnecessary complexity
   - Show the exact sequence that triggers the issue

4. The Fix
   - Fixed version of the buggy code
   - Explanation of WHY your fix addresses the root cause
   - All tests should pass after your fix

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Do not modify the test file (test_lru_cache.py)
- Maintain the existing API of the LRUCache class
- Your fix must address the root cause, not just work around symptoms
- Focus on explaining WHY the bug occurs, not just what is wrong

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your implementation.
