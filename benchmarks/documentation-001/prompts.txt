=== TASK ===
Document the undocumented HTTP client library in `starter-code/http_client.py`.

The code is fully functional but has NO documentation - no docstrings, no comments, no examples. Your job is to:
1. Add comprehensive docstrings to all public classes and methods
2. Include working code examples in the docstrings
3. Follow Google-style Python docstring format
4. Ensure all examples can actually be executed

=== CONTEXT ===
The file `starter-code/http_client.py` contains an HTTP client library with:
- `HTTPClient` class - Main class for making HTTP requests
- `Response` class - Handles HTTP response data
- `RetryConfig` class - Configures retry behavior
- `HTTPError` exception - Custom exception for HTTP errors

The library is production-quality code but completely lacks documentation. Users cannot understand how to use it without reading the implementation.

Files:
- `starter-code/http_client.py` - The undocumented library to document

=== DELIVERABLES ===
Update `starter-code/http_client.py` with:

1. Class-level docstrings for all public classes
   - Brief description of the class purpose
   - List of key attributes
   - At least one usage example per class

2. Method-level docstrings for all public methods
   - Brief description of what the method does
   - Args section documenting all parameters
   - Returns section describing return value
   - Raises section for exceptions (if any)
   - Example section showing typical usage

3. Working code examples
   - Examples must be valid Python code
   - Examples should demonstrate realistic use cases
   - Examples must execute without errors

4. Consistent formatting
   - Use Google-style docstrings throughout
   - Maintain consistent structure across all docstrings
   - Clear, concise language

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Do NOT modify the actual implementation code (only add docstrings)
- Do NOT change function signatures or class interfaces
- Do NOT add new functionality - only documentation
- Code examples in docstrings must be executable Python
- Docstrings must accurately reflect what the code actually does
- Follow Google Python Style Guide for docstring format

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your implementation.
