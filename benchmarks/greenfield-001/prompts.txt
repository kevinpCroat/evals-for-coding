=== TASK ===
Build a complete URL shortener REST API from scratch in Python. This is a greenfield project - you're starting with an empty directory.

=== CONTEXT ===
Read the full specification in spec.md for detailed requirements.

You need to create a production-ready URL shortening service (like bit.ly) with the following features:
- Create shortened URLs from long URLs
- Redirect short codes to original URLs
- Track access statistics (view count)
- List all URLs in the system
- Delete URLs

The API should be RESTful, handle all edge cases gracefully, and include comprehensive tests.

=== DELIVERABLES ===
1. Working REST API implementation in Python (Flask or FastAPI)
2. Comprehensive test suite with >80% coverage
3. README.md with setup instructions and API documentation
4. requirements.txt with all dependencies
5. All source code files needed to run the service

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Use Python with Flask or FastAPI
- Store data in-memory (no database needed)
- Short codes must be 6-8 characters, alphanumeric
- Server must run on port 8080
- Validate URLs properly
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Handle all edge cases (invalid URLs, duplicates, missing data, etc.)

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your implementation.
The verification will test:
- All functional requirements work correctly
- Tests pass with good coverage
- Code quality metrics (complexity, duplication)
- Documentation completeness
