=== TASK ===
Analyze the legacy invoice processing codebase in starter-code/ and answer all questions in questions.json. Create an answers.json file with your responses.

=== CONTEXT ===
You have inherited a legacy Python invoice processing system with no documentation. The codebase consists of 6 modules (~450 lines total):
- invoice.py - Core invoice and item models with status workflow
- tax_calculator.py - Tax calculation with regional support
- payment_processor.py - Payment gateway and processing logic
- database.py - Data persistence for invoices and customers
- workflow.py - Business process orchestration
- validators.py - Validation logic

The questions.json file contains 20 questions covering:
- Architecture (main components, design patterns)
- Dependencies (which modules depend on what)
- Data flow (how data moves through the system)
- Change impact (what breaks if I change X)
- Business logic (how features work)

=== DELIVERABLES ===
Create answers.json in this format:
{
  "answers": [
    {"id": 1, "answer": "Your detailed answer..."},
    {"id": 2, "answer": "Your detailed answer..."},
    ...
  ]
}

Each answer should:
- Be technically accurate based on the actual code
- Include specific class/method/constant names
- Explain dependencies and data flows
- Identify all components affected by changes

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Answer all 20 questions
- Base answers on actual code analysis, not assumptions
- Be specific - reference actual names from the code
- Consider both direct and indirect dependencies
- Trace data flows end-to-end
- For impact analysis, identify ALL affected components

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your implementation.
