=== TASK ===
Optimize the slow log processing code to achieve at least 10x performance improvement.

The LogProcessor in `starter-code/data_processor.py` is functionally correct but extremely slow. Your job is to:
1. Analyze the profiler output in `profiler_output.txt`
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Optimize the code to run at least 10x faster
4. Ensure all tests still pass (behavior must be preserved)

=== CONTEXT ===
You have been provided with a log processing system that finds duplicate user sessions and computes session statistics. The implementation works correctly but has severe performance issues:

- Baseline performance: ~15 seconds for 5,000 log entries
- Target performance: <1.5 seconds (10x speedup)

Files:
- `starter-code/data_processor.py` - The slow implementation (optimize this)
- `starter-code/test_data_processor.py` - Test suite (must continue to pass)
- `starter-code/profiler_output.txt` - cProfile output showing bottlenecks
- `starter-code/benchmark.py` - Script to measure performance

The profiler reveals:
- 25 million regex operations (excessive re-parsing)
- O(n²) nested loops in find_duplicate_sessions
- Bubble sort in get_top_users
- Repeated parsing of the same data

=== DELIVERABLES ===
An optimized version of `starter-code/data_processor.py` that:

1. Achieves 10x+ performance improvement (baseline ~15s → <1.5s)
2. Passes all tests in test_data_processor.py with identical results
3. Uses better algorithms and data structures based on profiler insights:
   - Parse logs once and cache results
   - Use dictionaries for O(1) lookups instead of O(n) searches
   - Use O(n log n) sorting instead of O(n²) bubble sort
   - Eliminate redundant work

The API (class and method signatures) must remain the same.

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- All tests must pass - do not break functionality
- Maintain the same API (LogProcessor class with same methods)
- Results must be identical to the original implementation
- Focus on algorithmic improvements (not micro-optimizations)
- Use the profiler data to guide optimization decisions

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your implementation.
