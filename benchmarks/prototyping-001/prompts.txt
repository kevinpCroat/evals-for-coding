=== TASK ===
Build a proof-of-concept CLI tool that demonstrates real-time file watching and cloud synchronization. This is a prototyping exercise to validate technical feasibility.

=== CONTEXT ===
Read the full specification in spec.md and the technical question in technical_question.md.

Your goal is to quickly build a working demo that answers the question: "Can we build a CLI tool that watches local files and syncs them to cloud storage in real-time?"

This is NOT about production-quality code. Focus on:
- Getting something working fast
- Demonstrating the core concept
- Keeping it simple (minimal code, minimal dependencies)
- Making it runnable and observable

=== DELIVERABLES ===
1. Python script(s) implementing a file watching + sync CLI tool
2. README.md with usage instructions and demo steps
3. requirements.txt (if you use any dependencies beyond standard library)
4. Working demo that can be executed to show the concept

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Use Python (3.7+)
- Must work on Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS)
- Prefer minimal dependencies (standard library is best)
- Can mock/simulate the cloud backend (no real cloud API needed)
- Should be buildable in 20-30 minutes
- Focus on demonstrating feasibility, not building production features

=== APPROACH ===
Think like you're doing a quick technical spike:
1. Start with the simplest thing that could work
2. File watching: Use a library like `watchdog` or implement basic polling
3. Cloud sync: Mock it with a local directory or simple data structure
4. CLI: Can be a simple Python script with command-line arguments
5. Test it works by creating/modifying files and seeing them "sync"

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your implementation.
Your prototype will be scored on:
- Does the demo actually run? (40%)
- Does it answer the feasibility question? (30%)
- Is it simple and easy to understand? (20%)
- Was it built quickly/iteratively? (10%)
