=== TASK ===
Rewrite the recursive tree traversal functions in starter-code/tree_traversal.py to use iterative implementations with explicit stacks instead of recursion.

=== CONTEXT ===
The file starter-code/tree_traversal.py contains 6 functions that currently use recursion:
- inorder_traversal() - In-order tree traversal
- postorder_traversal() - Post-order tree traversal
- max_depth() - Calculate maximum tree depth
- find_path_sum() - Find if a root-to-leaf path sum exists
- collect_leaves() - Collect all leaf node values
- tree_map() - Apply a function to all nodes

All functions must be rewritten to use iterative approaches with explicit stack data structures (lists or deques) while maintaining identical behavior.

A comprehensive test suite is provided in starter-code/test_tree_traversal.py with 40+ tests covering:
- Normal cases (balanced trees, various structures)
- Edge cases (empty trees, single nodes, deep trees)
- Performance tests (100+ level deep trees)

=== DELIVERABLES ===
1. Modified starter-code/tree_traversal.py with all 6 functions rewritten iteratively
2. All function signatures must remain unchanged
3. All tests must pass (run: pytest starter-code/test_tree_traversal.py -v)
4. Code should include clear comments explaining the stack-based approach

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Do NOT modify the TreeNode class definition
- Do NOT modify function signatures (names, parameters, return types)
- Do NOT use helper functions that are themselves recursive
- Must use explicit data structures (lists/deques) as stacks
- Must preserve all type hints
- Performance should not degrade more than 20%

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your implementation.

The verification script will:
1. Run all tests and check pass rate (60% of score)
2. Compare performance against recursive baseline (20% of score)
3. Verify specific edge cases pass (20% of score)

Minimum passing score: 70/100
