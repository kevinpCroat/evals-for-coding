=== TASK ===
Write a comprehensive test suite for the shopping_cart.py module. The module currently has NO tests, and you need to create them from scratch.

Your goal is to write high-quality tests that:
1. Achieve high code coverage (>90%)
2. Actually catch bugs (high mutation score >80%)
3. Are independent and can run in any order
4. Have meaningful assertions that validate behavior

=== CONTEXT ===
The shopping_cart.py module contains an e-commerce shopping cart implementation with:
- Item class for products (with price, quantity validation)
- ShoppingCart class for cart operations
- Discount and tax calculation logic
- Loyalty points functionality
- Multiple custom exceptions for error handling

The code has various edge cases you need to test:
- Empty carts
- Negative values and boundary conditions
- Multiple discounts
- Decimal precision in price calculations
- Type validation
- Exception handling

=== DELIVERABLES ===
Create a file named test_shopping_cart.py that contains:
1. Tests for the Item class (initialization, validation, total calculation)
2. Tests for the ShoppingCart class (all public methods)
3. Edge case tests (empty cart, boundaries, errors)
4. Tests for discount and tax calculations
5. Tests for loyalty points
6. Exception handling tests

Use pytest as your testing framework. Organize tests logically using test classes or functions.

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
- Use pytest framework
- Tests must be independent (no shared state)
- Use descriptive test names
- Include meaningful assertions
- Use pytest features like fixtures and parametrize where appropriate
- Do not modify shopping_cart.py - only create test_shopping_cart.py

=== VERIFICATION ===
Run `./verification/verify.sh` to check your implementation.

Your tests will be evaluated on:
- Coverage: 30% weight
- Mutation score (ability to catch bugs): 40% weight
- Test independence: 15% weight
- Assertion quality: 15% weight
